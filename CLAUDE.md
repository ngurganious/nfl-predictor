# EdgeIQ — CLAUDE.md

> **This file is for Claude.** It covers how to work in this codebase.
> For what EdgeIQ is and its product standards, see `EdgeIQ.md`.
> For what to build next, see `PRD.md`.
> For current build progress, see `ROADMAP.md`.

## Workflow Requirements- update CLAUDE.md before every git commit
- always ask claritying questions in planning mode
- For any architectural decision or model change, use extended thinking before proposing a solution

## Role
You are the **sole engineer** on this project — responsible for all backend logic, data pipelines, model training, UI/UX design, CSS, and Streamlit layout. There is no other AI assistant involved.

## Roadmap Rule (Required)
After completing **any build item** — no matter how small — you MUST update `ROADMAP.md`:
1. Change the item's status from `🔲 Not Started` or `🚧 In Progress` → `✅ Done`
2. Fill in the **Completed** date (use today's date)
3. Add a one-line **Note** summarizing what file(s) changed and what was done
4. If a build item is partially complete, mark it `🚧 In Progress` with a note on what remains

This rule applies to ALL build items in the roadmap, including low-effort fixes. Do not batch updates — mark done immediately after each item is finished.

## Project Overview
EdgeIQ is a multi-sport ML prediction platform (NFL + NHL + MLB). Entry point is `app.py`, deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud. See `EdgeIQ.md` for the full product definition.

## API Keys

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in:
```
RAPIDAPI_KEY=...   # Tank01 NFL live data — rapidapi.com
ODDS_API_KEY=...   # Vegas lines — the-odds-api.com (500 req/month free)
```
ESPN, Open-Meteo, NHL API, and PFR need no keys.

For Streamlit Cloud deployment, add both keys in the app's **Secrets** section (TOML format).

## Git Workflow (Required)

1. **Before making changes** — run `git diff` and `git status` to understand current state, then commit any uncommitted work so there's a clean rollback point
2. **After making changes** — run `git diff` to review everything before committing; summarize what changed
3. **Always commit when done** — or explicitly offer to rollback with `git restore` if the changes aren't right
4. Never leave the repo in a dirty state at the end of a task

---

## Code Style Rules

- **No type annotations** unless already present in the file
- **No docstrings** on functions unless already present
- **No comments** unless logic is non-obvious
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Keep solutions minimal — don't add features beyond what's asked
- All Streamlit widget keys must be unique — use prefixes (`nfl_`, `nhl_`, `g{idx}_`, etc.)
- Session state keys follow established patterns:
  - NFL game expanders: `g{idx}_stay_open`
  - NHL game expanders: `nhl_g{idx}_expanded`
  - Pre-calc guards: `nfl_precalc_done`, `nhl_precalc_done`
  - Depth chart cache: `dc_{team}`

## NFL Model — Key Facts

- **26 features**, GBC + RF stacking ensemble → LogReg meta
- **69.3% accuracy** on 2024–25 holdout (practical ceiling for free public data)
- Top predictors in order: spread_line, qb_score_diff, epa_total_diff, elo_diff
- Features **intentionally excluded** (tested, hurt CV): rest days, is_dome, is_grass,
  div_game, l5_win_pct, rolling game-level EPA, interaction features, situational flags
- O/U model: Ridge on residual (actual_total − vegas_line), 54.4% accuracy

## NHL Model — Key Facts

- **58.0% accuracy** on holdout
- Features: ELO diff, team EPA, goalie quality diff, recent form
- Backtesting Kelly uses **game-specific moneylines** derived from model probability
  + 4.55% vig (not flat -110) — heavy favorites (-200+) require >66% confidence to bet

---

## Testing Approach

No automated test suite. Validation is done by:
1. Running `streamlit run app.py` and manually testing each tab
2. Checking backtesting accuracy numbers in the Backtesting tab
3. Running the relevant `build_*.py` script and checking printed output/logs
4. For model changes: compare CV score in retrain output vs baseline 69.3%

---

## Deployment

Hosted on **Streamlit Community Cloud** from `github.com/ngurganious/nfl-predictor`.
- Branch: `master`
- Main file: `app.py`
- Secrets: `RAPIDAPI_KEY`, `ODDS_API_KEY`

To redeploy after changes: `git add ... && git commit && git push` — Streamlit auto-redeploys.
Cold start takes ~2–3 minutes on first load.
